mahara (0.9.0~dev) unstable; urgency=low

  * The new networking support in Mahara requires the curl, openssl and xmlrpc
    libs. If they are not installed, you will see environment level errors on each
    screen of your Mahara installation. You can solve this by disabling logging of
    environment level errors in config.php, or installing php5-{curl,openssl,xmlrpc}
