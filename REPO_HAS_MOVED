Oh hai. Just so you know, the git repository for Mahara is now at
git.mahara.org. You can do one of two things to update to using the new
repository:

1. edit the file .git/config. It will have a block something like (not
   necessarily exactly like) this:

       [remote "origin"]
           url = http://git.catalyst.net.nz/mahara.git
           fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*

   Change the url line to read:

       url = http://git.mahara.org/git/mahara.git

Then run 'git fetch origin' or 'git pull' as you'd normally do and see if you
get new stuff.

(ps: I don't know what will happen if you change the protocol from http to git,
but it's probably better if you can use the git protocol, it's smarter and will
result in you downloading less stuff)

2. Remove this repository and clone afresh:

       git clone git://git.mahara.org/mahara.git

kthxbye
